## Project 1

    I am Anish, This was my first project to be pushed on Github.
    It was quiet challenging not to think on my own but rather 
    to build something by someone's needs.
    The sizing and fonting part just took me half an hour, but the positionning was very very hard as I needed to meet someone's demands. It was taking over my nerves.The biggest problem I faced other challenge with the navbar.
The coder community helped me a lot on my way building the webpage.
